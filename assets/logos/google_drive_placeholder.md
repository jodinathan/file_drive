# Google Drive Logo Placeholder

Since I cannot create actual PNG files, here's what you need to do:

1. Download the official Google Drive icon from Google's brand resources:
   - Go to: https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/branding
   - Download the appropriate logo size (24x24px or 48x48px recommended)

2. Save the file as: `google_drive.png` in this directory

3. Ensure the logo:
   - Has a transparent background
   - Is in PNG format
   - Is appropriately sized (24x24px minimum, 48x48px preferred)
   - Follows Google's brand guidelines

The app will automatically use this logo once you place it here. If the logo is not found, it will fall back to the Material Design `drive_eta` icon with Google's brand color (#4285F4).

## Alternative: Use Material Icon
If you prefer to use the Material Design icon instead of a custom logo, the app will automatically fall back to `Icons.drive_eta` which provides a consistent look with Material 3 theming.
